# Page Navigation

- **Responsive Scrollable Navs** for seamless browsing across devices
- **Rename, Duplicate, and Delete Options** to efficiently manage items
- **Smooth Drag-and-Drop Functionality** for an intuitive and interactive user experience

## Tradeoffs Made

**Performance vs. Functionality**

- Used multiple state variables and refs for each draggable item, which could impact performance with many tabs
- Chose real-time drag feedback over optimized rendering
- Implemented complex popover positioning logic that requires DOM measurements


**UX vs. Technical Complexity**

- Added multiple interaction modes (click, double-click, drag, dropdown) which increases cognitive load but provides flexibility
- Used conditional rendering for edit mode instead of always-rendered inputs to reduce DOM complexity
- Implemented custom focus management instead of relying on browser defaults for better control


**Accessibility vs. Visual Design**

- Prioritized visual hover states and animations over comprehensive keyboard navigation
- Used opacity transitions for dropdown triggers that may not be accessible to all users
- Focused on mouse interactions more than keyboard-only workflows


**Code Organization vs. Rapid Development**

- Kept drag logic and UI logic in the same components for faster implementation
- Used inline event handlers instead of extracted callback functions
- Mixed presentation and business logic for quicker iteration


## How I'd Improve It Further

**Performance Optimizations**

- Implement virtualization for large numbers of tabs
- Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive calculations
- Debounce scroll and resize handlers
- Implement proper cleanup for all event listeners and timeouts


**Accessibility Enhancements**

- Add comprehensive keyboard navigation (Tab, Arrow keys, Space, Enter)
- Implement proper ARIA labels and roles for screen readers
- Add focus management for modal states
- Ensure proper color contrast and focus indicators


**User Experience Improvements**

- Add undo/redo functionality for all operations
- Implement drag preview with better visual feedback
- Add keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+R for rename, Delete key, etc.)
- Include loading states and error handling
- Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions


**Code Quality & Maintainability**

- Extract custom hooks for drag logic, editing state, and popover management
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces and error boundaries
- Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Create a proper state management solution (Context or external store)
- Separate business logic from presentation components


**Advanced Features**

- Add tab grouping and nested organization
- Implement tab search and filtering
- Add drag-and-drop between different containers
- Include tab templates and bulk operations
- Add persistence and sync capabilities


The current implementation prioritizes getting a working prototype quickly over long-term maintainability, which is appropriate for initial development but would need refactoring for production use.
